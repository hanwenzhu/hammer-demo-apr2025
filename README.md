## System setup

(From Josh's ntp-toolkit README:)

Before experimenting with the current hammer evaluation tool, make sure you are able to invoke the `hammer` tactic successfully by installing [zipperposition](https://github.com/sneeuwballen/zipperposition) (version 2.1) and go to the following Lean code (at the end of [HammerDemo/Setup.lean]):
```
example {p q r : Prop} (hp : p) (hq : q) (hr : r) : p âˆ§ q := by
  hammer [*] { simpTarget := no_target }
```

This code should prove the goal and yield the following suggestion:
```
Try this:
  apply @Classical.byContradiction
  intro negGoal
  duper [hp, hq, negGoal] {preprocessing := full}
```

## Demos
Demos can be found under `HammerDemo/`.
